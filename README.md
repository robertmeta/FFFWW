## Fuzzy Finder For Windows Windows

This is a little utility to allow fuzzy finding and selecting of windows on
Windows.

I removed the keybindings, use a local keybinding program to run this, I use AutoHotKey.

## TODO

- Make it support listing and selecting chrome tabs.  I tried using Automation* to do this, WAY too slow
